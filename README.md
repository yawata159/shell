# SAsh (The Seiji-Anton shell)

## Features

A lovely shell capable of executing commands in ones PATH.  
Can be used very similarly to your standard Bash shell.  
* Presents your host name and current working directory in a beautiful light blue.
* Will fork and execute commands.
* Can run multiple commands listed in one line, separated by ";"
* Capable of all kinds of redirection, including "<", ">", ">>", "&>", "2>". Also supports pipes! "|"
* You can put as many spaces between flags and commands as you like!

## Attempted
* Did create a colorized "ls" originally, using default colors per operating system, however was dropped in final version due to reorganization of methods and lack to time to re-implement.
* ~/[nextdir] Does not work. However, ~ itself does work as home.
